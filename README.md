# GWU_DNSC_3288_Project
Digit Recognizer. Introduction to Deep Learning, Neural Networks, and Pattern Recognition.

## Basic Information
- **Person or organization developing model**: Jonathan, jon@yahoo.com
- **Model date**: November, 2024
- **Model version**: 1.0
- **License**: MIT *?*
- **Model implementation code**: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KXlQ71soA8vGusOqcWzRjidf3ikVfA7K?usp=drive_link *?*

## Intended Use
- **Primary intended uses**: This model is an *example* multiclass digit classifier, incorporating various deep learning techniques from the Keras library. The techniques closely followed Kaggle's *Deep Learning Course*, and a handful of tutorials; notably, the *Deep neural network the Keras way* and *Simple deep MLP with Keras* tutorials (all found on the 'Overview' tab of the Digit Recognizer kaggle page).
- **Primary intended users**: Professor Hall and colleagues in GWU DNSC 3288.
- **Out-of-scope use cases**: Any use beyond GWU DNSC 3288, as an educational example, is out-of-scope.
